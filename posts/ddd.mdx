We all know about dopamine. But let me give you a real quick crash course dopamine is the brain component that provides us with those little spikes of joy, fun, happiness. The thrill when things *just click*.

### But how do you code with dopamine?
### Or build systems that *give* it to you?

To me, a lot of that "dopamine coding" isn't work itself—but everything **surrounding** the work. Chatting with colleagues, having lunch, debugging someone on some random thing, tinkering with side projects. That's the good stuff that got me hooked on software development. And over time, paired with consistency—that's what made me into that person who just *keeps going*, even on the miserable days.


### But not everybody has that sort of situation, y'know?

Not all work is encouraging. Not all teams assist. Sometimes you're just on your own in the tunnel trying to light your own path. And that's fine because I discovered that in order to keep moving forward, I had to generate my **own sparks**. And that began by engaging in small recreational programming projects. Messing around. Ricing up my Linux environment. Installing pointless (but purty) plugins.

One day, I was experimenting with theming my terminal. That branched into customizing my shell, creating aliases for convenience commands. And lo and behold, even something as mundane as `git push` provided me with a mini dopamine boost. Seeing the text zip past, colors flash, and animations move—it began making me *look forward* to doing tedious things.

### CI/CD Pipelines

That same fascination led me to create CI/CD pipelines on my own projects. And maaaan, seeing those stages of the pipeline go by? Build → Test → Deploy… green check, green check, green check. So fulfilling.

But the surprise: the **failures** I learned more from. When tests crashed, when builds failed, I *had* to know Docker better, tweak my configs, look through logs. To debug the pipeline wasn't an obligation—it was beating a tough boss in a game. You learn, level up, and you make it next time a bit quicker.

### Testing (Yes, it slaps)

Okay I see it, **testing** gets a bad name. It's that thing you're "supposed" to do, but nobody wants to deal with. I felt the same. Couldn't even distinguish unit, integration, and e2e testing at the time. Honestly, sometimes I still can't tell them apart. But what brought me back?

Those *green ticks*. That "All tests passed" feeling. Whether it's JUnit or your IDE celebrating with confetti when your test suite runs without errors, it just *feels good*. It's like emptying your inbox or setting a workout PR.

And the ultimate kicker? Achieving 100% code coverage. Sure, I know 100% isn't always great coverage—but dopamine doesn't discriminate. It *feels* like a win.

### Task Managers (Underrated Dopamine Sources)

Let's not snooze on this **task management** is a hidden dopamine farm.

You may think following tasks is just for productivity nerds, but listen: creating your own task manager informs you about how frameworks work, how state transitions, and how UI can feel *alive*. But even with a simple one, like a Markdown checklist or GitHub Projects, it feels different when you're crossing things off.

Occasionally, I do make a note of things I've already done *just* so I can cross them off. It's not about productivity it's about momentum. Micro-wins piling up until you look and see you've actually delivered something significant.

### The Real Hack: Stack All 3

If you're a student or doing personal projects, I find that putting all three of these together **custom setups**, **pipelines**, and **task systems** really puts you in touch with what dev work is like nowadays. You begin to get the idea that your little universe of projects is a living system.

The point isn't to be super productive. The point is to discover the **smallest, easiest thing** that makes you feel that little happiness—a pretty animation, a green checkmark, a smooth alias—and leverages it to get you started on things you wouldn't otherwise engage in.

When you're stuck, out of ideas for work, or just don't wanna code—do something small:

- Install a new terminal font
- Add some transition to your CSS buttons
- Customize your bash prompt
- Learn a single awesome new git command
- Write a small test just to witness the green tick

Every dull or infuriating task is a secret attempt at happiness.
Not manufactured happiness, but *earned happiness* the kind that happens only when you fiddle, adjust, and make something feel like **yours**.

That's how you construct with dopamine.
That's how you *keep going*.
