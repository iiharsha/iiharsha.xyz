We all know what dopamine is. But lemme give you a super quick lesson—dopamine is the part of the brain that gives us those little hits of joy, fun, happiness. The buzz when things *just click*.

---

### But how do you write code with dopamine?
### Or create systems that *give* it to you?

For me, a lot of that "dopamine coding" doesn’t come from work itself—but from everything **around** the work. Talking to teammates, grabbing lunch, helping someone debug something random, messing with side projects. That’s the stuff that made me fall in love with software development. And over time, coupling that love with consistency—that's what turned me into someone who just *keeps going*, even on the boring days.

---

### But not everyone has that kind of environment, y’know?

Not every job is supportive. Not every team is helpful. Sometimes it feels like you're alone in the tunnel trying to light your own way. And that’s okay—because I found that to keep going, I had to create my **own sparks**. And that started with doing little recreational programming activities. Tinkering. Ricing my Linux setup. Installing useless (but pretty) plugins.

One day, I was messing around with theming my terminal. That led to customizing my shell, writing aliases for fun commands. And suddenly, even something as basic as `git push` gave me a mini dopamine hit. Watching the text fly by, colors pop, and animations flow—it started to make me *look forward* to doing boring stuff.

---

### CI/CD Pipelines

That same curiosity made me build CI/CD pipelines for my own projects. And maaaan, watching those pipeline stages pass? 🔥 Build → Test → Deploy… green check, green check, green check. So satisfying.

But here's the twist: the **failures** taught me way more. When tests failed, when builds broke, I *had* to understand Docker better, fix my configs, dig into logs. Debugging the pipeline wasn’t just a chore—it was like beating a hard boss in a game. You learn, level up, and next time you get through a little faster.

---

### Testing (Yes, it slaps)

Okay I get it—**testing** gets a bad rap. It’s that thing you’re “supposed” to do, but nobody wants to touch. I felt the same way. Couldn’t even tell the difference between unit, integration, and e2e testing back then. Honestly, sometimes I still mix them up. But what kept me coming back?

Those *green ticks*. That "All tests passed" moment. Whether it's JUnit or your IDE throwing confetti when your test suite passes, it just *feels good*. It’s like clearing your inbox or hitting a workout PR.

And the real kicker? Getting 100% code coverage. Yeah, I know 100% doesn’t always mean good coverage—but dopamine doesn’t care. It *feels* like a win.

---

### Task Managers (Underrated Dopamine Sources)

Let’s not sleep on this—**task management** is a secret dopamine farm.

You might think tracking tasks is just for productivity nerds, but hear me out: building your own task manager teaches you how frameworks work, how state flows, and how UI can feel *alive*. But even using a basic one, like a Markdown checklist or GitHub Projects, hits different when you're checking stuff off.

Sometimes, I write down tasks I already did *just* so I can tick them off. It’s not about being productive—it’s about momentum. Micro-wins stacking up until you realize you’ve actually shipped something meaningful.

---

### The Real Hack: Combine All 3

If you're a student or working on personal projects, I think combining these three things—**custom setups**, **pipelines**, and **task systems**—gives you a real feel for what modern dev work is like. You start to see your little world of projects as a living system.

The idea isn’t to be hyper-productive. The idea is to find the **smallest, simplest thing** that sparks that little joy—an animation, a green tick, a slick alias—and use it to pull yourself into things you normally wouldn’t want to do.

---

When you're stuck, bored at work, or just don't feel like coding—try something small:

- Install a new terminal font
- Add a transition to your CSS buttons
- Customize your bash prompt
- Learn one cool new git command
- Make a tiny test just to see the green tick

---

See every boring or frustrating task as a hidden shot at joy.
Not fake joy, but *earned joy*—the kind that only comes when you tweak, tinker, and make something feel like **yours**.

That’s how you build with dopamine.
That’s how you *keep going*.
